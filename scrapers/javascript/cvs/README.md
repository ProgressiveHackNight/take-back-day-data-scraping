# TBD CVS Web Scraper (Node.js)

Writes a JSON file containing drug take back locations listed on CVS website (https://www.cvs.com/content/safer-communities-locate) and NABP website (https://nabp.pharmacy/initiatives/awarxe/drug-disposal-locator/) and others?

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Developed on MacOS 10.12.6
node v7.6.0
npm v4.1.2
```

### Installing

After cloning the repository add Google API Key
```
Get Google API Key (https://developers.google.com/console)
 - This key will need to be saved in .env file in cwd directory
 - GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=<Your private API key>
```
then,
```
npm install
```

in cwd directory. 



### Usage

```
node index.js --<scraper> --<env>
```
from cwd directory, where "scraper" is one of [cvs, nabp] and "env" is one of [dev, test, prod].

"dev" runs against a mocked http request to compile locations
"test" runs against 2 actual http requests to compile locations
"prod" runs all http requests (up to 62) to compile all the locations

If successful, you should see JSON file saved called ./cvs/data/<scraper>.json.

## Running the tests

Todo: Write tests

```
Todo:
npm test
```

## Built With

* [google maps api](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-js) - Node.js client library for Google Maps API Web Services. Used to convert physical address to lat/lng
* [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. Used to make http requests easier.
* [cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio) - Fast, flexible & lean implementation of core jQuery designed specifically for the server. Used to make dealing with DOM easier.
* [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Used to simplify this task.
* [validate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validate) - Validate object properties in javascript. Used to ensure data parsed from DOM meets DB Schema required.

## Contributing
Creating a new scraper should only require creating a js file similar to the file located in ./cvs/lib/scrape-cvs.js and adding it to the allowed scrapers in ./index.js. This file should return an object with the following signature:

```
{
	// Properties
	src: <string> Unique identifier for this scraper
	url: <string> Remote URL to request for scraping
	collection: <array> The compiled list of locations from scraper
	addresses: <object> A temporary hash variable to avoid duplicates from scraping
	processed: <number> A temporary hash variable to print progress in the CLI

	// Methods
	toHTML: <async function> Sends http request and receives html response
	toDOM: <function> Takes HTML and converts it to a DOM node with an API similar to jQuery
	toJSON: <function> Generates a validated model from the DOM node created in the toDOM function, then adds it to the collection
	toCollection: <async function> Does some additional transforms on the collection (for example geocoding), if required. Otherwise just return the collection
	toFile: <function> Converts the collection to a JSON string, then saves it to the disk.
}
```

A successful scrape should create a JSON file in ./cvs/data/<scraper>.json with this signature:

```
[{
 "Location": "Albany Police Department",
 "Street Address": "165 Henry Johnson Blvd",
 "City": "Albany",
 "Zip": "12210",
 "County": "Albany",
 "Phone": "(518) 462-8013",
 "Hours": "Available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.",
 "Note": "Accepted: any prescription or over-the-counter medications. Not accepted: needles.",
 "Latitude": "42.662809",
 "Longitude: "-73.760516",
 "Type": "Police"
}, â€¦]
```

Note: only "Location", "Street Address", "City", "Zip" are required


## Needs

* Tests
* Documentation
* Create different outputs based on env like ./cvs/data/<scraper>-<env>.json
* [done - 92405ba] Switch mock data as CLI input like dev/test/prod when calling 'node index.js' (I am currently commenting require statements in the code)
