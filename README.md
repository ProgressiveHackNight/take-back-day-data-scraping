# Takeback Day Hackathon
## Scrape the resource list
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, in collaboration with Civic Hall and Progressive Hacknight, is organizing a challenge to help improve the efficacy of The National Prescription Drugs Take Back Day. According to the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, a majority of abused prescription drugs were obtained from family and friends, often from the home medicine cabinet. Take Back Day aims to provide a safe, convenient, and responsible means of disposing of prescription drugs, while also educating the general public about the potential for abuse of medications. 

### Take Back Day Pre-Hack - February 25
A day of brainstorming and collaboration on projects that would help to make information about safe prescription drug disposal more accessible, build awareness of the issue and the need to be a part of the solution, and encourage participation in Take Back Day. A selection of projects will continue to being developed by coders on the Take Back Day Hack on March 11.

### Take Back Day HackNight - February 27
A Progressive HackNight discussion on opioid abuse. We will cover the issues surrounding the opioid crisis, what’s been done to address the crisis in New York State under Attorney General Schneiderman’s leadership, and how can we as technologists support the recovery of those affected and assist in alleviating the crisis. 

### Take Back Day Hack - March 11
A full day of hacking dedicated to implementing and developing the technologies discussed in the last two events. The goal is to work on projects that will achieve the three key things that we’re aiming for to move Take Back Day efforts forward: 
- **Lowering The Barrier:** Making it easier for people to drop off their unused medicines by helping them find collection sites and safer approaches to disposing of prescription drugs
- **Outreach:** Creating effective campaigns for people to learn more about Take Back Day and building tech to help notify and remind them as Take Back Day approaches
- **Inform:** Effectively educating the public about the opioid crisis and how best to help those victimized by it

Where can we find any research/data available/articles?
We have data sources from the Attorney General's office in this public repo and can try and scrape other sites if we need to. DisposeMyMeds.org (community pharmacies) and Walgreens (maybe tied to CVS locations might be separate, needs to be looked into.) NYS Department of Conservation also has locations.
